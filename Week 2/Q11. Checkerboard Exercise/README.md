# Checkerboard Exercise
The `index.html` file contains 25 `<div>` elements, each with the class of `square`. Please create a simple checkerboard pattern by making the even squares black and the odd squares red.  Your result should look like the image below.  Please write your styles in `app.css`, and do not change any of the styles in `NO_TOUCHING.css` :)

Please note: the solution needs to select both the even and odd squares, changing the background color of the entire board will work visually, but will not pass the exercise parameters.
